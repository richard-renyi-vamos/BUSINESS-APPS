Creating a tool to analyze a company's business efficiency can be really insightful! Here's a Python script that calculates some standard business efficiency metrics based on inputs like revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and employee count. I'll include metrics like profit margin, asset turnover ratio, return on assets (ROA), and revenue per employee to give a rounded view of efficiency.

You can modify the function inputs to suit more specific business metrics if you want to add further granularity.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Define function to calculate business efficiency metrics
def business_efficiency_analysis(revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, num_employees):
    """
    Analyzes business efficiency based on key metrics.

    Parameters:
    - revenue (float): Total revenue generated by the company.
    - expenses (float): Total expenses incurred by the company.
    - assets (float): Total assets of the company.
    - liabilities (float): Total liabilities of the company.
    - num_employees (int): Total number of employees in the company.

    Returns:
    - dict: A dictionary with calculated efficiency metrics.
    """
    # Calculate profit margin
    profit = revenue - expenses
    profit_margin = (profit / revenue) * 100 if revenue else 0  # percentage

    # Calculate asset turnover ratio
    asset_turnover = revenue / assets if assets else 0

    # Calculate return on assets (ROA)
    return_on_assets = (profit / assets) * 100 if assets else 0  # percentage

    # Calculate debt-to-assets ratio (to assess leverage)
    debt_to_assets = (liabilities / assets) * 100 if assets else 0  # percentage

    # Calculate revenue per employee
    revenue_per_employee = revenue / num_employees if num_employees else 0

    # Compile results into a dictionary
    efficiency_metrics = {
        'Profit Margin (%)': profit_margin,
        'Asset Turnover Ratio': asset_turnover,
        'Return on Assets (ROA) (%)': return_on_assets,
        'Debt to Assets Ratio (%)': debt_to_assets,
        'Revenue per Employee': revenue_per_employee
    }

    return efficiency_metrics

# Example usage with sample data
# (You can replace these values with actual data for analysis)
revenue = 1000000  # e.g., 1 million in revenue
expenses = 700000  # e.g., 700,000 in expenses
assets = 500000    # e.g., 500,000 in assets
liabilities = 200000  # e.g., 200,000 in liabilities
num_employees = 50  # e.g., 50 employees

# Analyze the company's business efficiency
metrics = business_efficiency_analysis(revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, num_employees)

# Convert metrics to a DataFrame for better readability
metrics_df = pd.DataFrame(metrics.items(), columns=['Metric', 'Value'])
print(metrics_df)
Explanation of Key Metrics ðŸ“Š
Profit Margin (%) - Measures how much of each dollar of revenue is retained as profit. Higher values indicate better profitability.
Asset Turnover Ratio - Shows how efficiently assets generate revenue. A higher ratio means assets are being used more effectively.
Return on Assets (ROA) (%) - Reflects the company's ability to generate profit from its assets. Higher values show better asset efficiency.
Debt to Assets Ratio (%) - Indicates the portion of assets financed by debt, with lower values typically seen as less risky.
Revenue per Employee - Measures productivity per employee, helpful in understanding labor efficiency.
Run this code with your own data, and youâ€™ll have an efficient tool for initial business efficiency analysis! ðŸ“ˆ
